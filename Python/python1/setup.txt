1. after pip install Django was entered, it downloaded a copy of Django and it said
Successfully installed Django-1.10.6.

2. pip list was used which shows the list of pip installs. The following are the pip installs on my mac.
click (6.7)
Django (1.10.6)
Flask (0.12)
itsdangerous (0.24)
Jinja2 (2.9.5)
MarkupSafe (0.23)
pip (9.0.1)
requests (2.13.0)
setuptools (18.2)
virtualenv (15.1.0)
Werkzeug (0.11.15).

3. pip install Django was retyped and it stated that this request was already satisfied
Requirement already satisfied: Django in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages

4. pip freeze gave a list of the installed packages just like pip list however, on further research,
(stackoverflow..) it stated that pip freeze outputs installed packages it its requirement format and pip list
lists all the installed packages including editable.

5. pip uninstall Django was then undertaken where the bash listed all the Django files that would be deleted and a y/n
to confirm if you really wanted to delete Django.

6. pip show Django was then tried of which there was no response.

7. pip search Flask was the last command executed of which it listed all the features associated with Flask.
